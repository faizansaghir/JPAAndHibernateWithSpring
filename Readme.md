1. <strong>Hibernate</strong> <br>
   It is a framework for persisting/saving Java objects in a database. <br>
   Advantages of using Hibernate: <br>
   &emsp;a. It handles low-level SQL
   &emsp;b. Minimizes the amount of JDBC code to be developed
   &emsp;c. Provides Object-to-Relational-Mapping(ORM) <br><br>
2. <strong>JPA</strong> <br>
    Jakarta Persistence API previously known as Java Persistence API. <br>
    It is Standard API for Object-to-Relational-Mapping(ORM). <br>
    It is only an interface i.e. only defines the interfaces and requires an implementation to be usable. <br>
    Some implementations of JPA are Hibernate and EclipseLink, but Hibernate is the most popular one. <br>
    Benefits of using JPA is: <br>
    &emsp;a. You can switch implementation if you face some problem in a particular vendor-implementation. <br>
    &emsp;b. Your code is not tied to vendor-specific implementation, thus making it flexible and loosely coupled. <br><br>
